<p>Artist Bio </br> Karen Rose was born in Oxford in 1956 and lived in South Africa for most of her teenage years before returning to Northampton in 1979. She now paints and holds art classes in Oundle and visits France as often as possible. Karen’s years in South Africa had a profound effect on her work; the sumptuous colours of the landscapes, the skies and the people of the country are reflected in the opulence and vibrancy of her paintings. As she explains: “I find everyday life so crowded with irresistible images and impressions I feel almost overwhelmed, it is far more frustrating not attempting to paint all these images than going through the actual process of making them.” Many of her paintings are semi-abstract celebrations of light, texture and colour.</p>

<p>Traditional Style = Landscapes & Oil Paintings </br> If your home sports more of a comfortable, classic feel - think Chesterfield sofas and warm open log fires - then traditional landscapes or oil paintings of earthy objects will be best suited to your interior. The warm rich tones of the oil paints will lend themselves well to the ambiance of your home whilst landscapes will evoke feelings of joy and happiness, especially if they depict somewhere dear to your heart.</p>

<p>Modern Interior = Contemporary Art</br>If your interior features crisp straight lines, simple solid colours and plenty of space you should look for contemporary pieces, which demonstrate similar attributes. Strong geometric shapes and bold colours are ideal if you are going for an attention-grabbing piece, or if you are looking for something less striking why not try something that has simple line work in one or two neutral colours housed in a solid frame of a similar tone.</p>
